#Function definition
def SelectionSort (l):

	#for loop - number of rounds/iterations over the list we need to take
		#what's my largest number in the list? use max()
			
		#What's the position of this number?
		
		#Where am I swapping it to?
		#swap the number at the end of the list to the index where the largest number is

		#swap the largest number to the 'end' of the list (remember the end is decreasing with each round/pass).

		
		print(l)		#so that we can see the output after every round/pass/cycle/iteration
		
	return l			#return the fully sorted list
