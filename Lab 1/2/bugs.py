#Thoughts: both print statements are missing brackets and will not execute.
number = 99
song = 'red balloons'
print (number)
print (song)

#Thoughts: Number variable is not defined
number = 1
print(number)

#Thoughts: class is already a function therefore cannot be defined as a variable.
classSize = 4
print (classSize)

#Thoughts: number variable is defined properly
number = 55
print ( type(number) )

#Thoughts: this code has no bugs but I personally don't like the way the variable is written.
_number = 0
print ( _number )

#Thoughts: There is a lot of issues here. assert and del are already keywords therefore cant be a variable. 
#7_days_a_week variable cannot start with a number. mixture#5 variables cannot contain symbols. Therefore all these variable cant be printed if they cannot be defined.
#there was also an extra bracket after the food shop print statement.
# add the code here
strVariable1 = "compliant"
strVariable2 = 'delete'
tuple = ('am','I','a','tuple')
seven_days_a_week = "I code"
